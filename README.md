### Submission instructions and working with github
Goal here is to simulate a real world workflow so you will be submitting pull requests for review each week. In your own dev environment you should be working inside your own branch of the project, we'll go over how to do that below.

1. Getting dev enviroment setup:
   - if you don's already have a code editor set up (e.g. VSCode), find one you like and install it.
   - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your device. Can be found at: https://nodejs.org - install the latest stable version (current is: 16.15.0)
   - Create a local folder on your device to store the code you'll be working with
2. Getting setup with Github
   - If you don't already have a Github account, please set one up as this will be how we collaborate.
   - install git for windows on your device (https://gitforwindows.org/) and optionally use gitbash
   - fork the repository to your own github account from "https://github.com/Spiritusanti/JoelleChallenge", this video can help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lGpZkjnkt4 
   - clone the repository into the local folder using the command "git clone your-repo-link"
   - you should now have the code locally, open it up and explore the structure for a bit.
   - before you start coding make sure to create your own branch via "git branch joelle-dev" - this will be the branch you push to Github for review.
   - start coding!
3. making submissions:
   - Once you are ready to submit your code for review you can use the following commands:
     1. "git add ." - make sure you are at the top level of the directory
     2. "git commit -m'description of the work you did and any changes you made'"
     3. if it's the first commit you are making "git push -u origin joelle-dev", otherwise "git push"
   - Once your code has made it to github you will need to create a pull request
     1. follow the instructions from the video above
     2. make sure to outline any changes you made, raise issues, or ask questions in your commit message on Github!
     3. Let me know you submitted and then we can review your work before merging it into the main branch!
